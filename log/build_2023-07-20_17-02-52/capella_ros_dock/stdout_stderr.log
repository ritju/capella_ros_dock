[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:27 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcapella_ros_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "capella_ros_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "capella_ros_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    capella_ros_msgsConfig.cmake
    capella_ros_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "capella_ros_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "capella_ros_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "capella_ros_msgs" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
