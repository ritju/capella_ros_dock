[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:26 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcapella_ros_dock_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "capella_ros_dock_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "capella_ros_dock_msgs" with any of the following names:

    capella_ros_dock_msgsConfig.cmake
    capella_ros_dock_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "capella_ros_dock_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "capella_ros_dock_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "capella_ros_dock_msgs" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
